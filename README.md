# Swachh-Saathi
Swachh Saathi, an innovative environmental technology initiative, tackles the pressing challenge of waste management, which affects public health, ecosystems, and urban aesthetics, by introducing a technologydriven solution to enhance waste reporting, resolution, and awareness while encouraging sustainable community participation. The project integrates two platforms: a mobile application, developed using Flutter for seamless cross-platform functionality and Firebase for real-time data handling, and a Reactbased web interface with a WordPress-driven blog, each addressing distinct facets of waste management. 

The name "Swachh Saathi," meaning cleanliness companion, reflects its mission to provide an accessible system where users can report garbage accumulation with precise location details and images, track complaint statuses, and access educational content on sustainable practices.

The mobile app empowers users to register complaints through an interactive map interface and monitor resolutions in real time, while the web platform disseminates articles and tips to boost environmental consciousness. The methodology involves key steps: enabling complaint registration, ensuring transparency with real-time tracking, integrating with government systems for efficient resolutions, and promoting awareness through informative content, all designed to streamline waste management and foster citizen empowerment.
